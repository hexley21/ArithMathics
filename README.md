<h3>Built With</h3>
<strong>Clean Architecture</strong>
<br>
This app uses MVVM pattern for UI follows clean architecture concept brought up by <strong>Robert C. Martin</strong>, but how exactly is it realised in Arithmathics?

Arithmathics is divided into three layers:
- **app** - *A layer that interacts with the UI, mainly Android Stuff. It would include both domain and data layers.*
  - **Activities**
  - **Fragments**
  - **ViewModels**
  - **Dependency Injection**
  
- **domain** - *Contains the business logic of the application. It is the individual and innermost module. It‚Äôs a complete java module.*
  
  - **Repository interface** - A place where functionality blueprint is kept, which will be implemented in data module*
  - **UseCases** - Each individual functionality, like inserting or reading data from Database, they act as a mediator between our Repository and app module
  - **Models** - Entities or a Value Object

- **data** *- It includes the domain layer. It would implement the interface exposed by domain layer and dispenses data to app*
  - **Repository implementation** - Data module keeps repository implementation and waits to be injected into use-cases
  - **Database** - Repository implementations contain database functionality

**Data Flow**
  - If a user event is triggered in UI then we communicate it with ViewModel.
  - ViewModel connects with the use case to get the result for the action.
  - The use case then interacts with the repository class to get the solution from database or preference

**MVVM**
- [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.

**Components**
- Database - [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
- Dependency Injection - [Dagger Hilt](https://github.com/google/dagger)
- Asynchronous approach - [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
